# PowerPulse-Household-Energy-Usage-Forecast
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict household energy consumption based on historical data. Using this model, consumers can gain insights into their usage patterns, while energy providers can forecast demand more effectively.

Business Use Cases:
1.	Energy Management for Households: Monitor energy usage, reduce bills, and promote energy-efficient habits.
2.	Demand Forecasting for Energy Providers: Predict demand for better load management and pricing strategies.
3.	Anomaly Detection: Identify irregular patterns indicating faults or unauthorized usage.
4.	Smart Grid Integration: Enable predictive analytics for real-time energy optimization.
5.	Environmental Impact: Reduce carbon footprints and support conservation initiatives.
